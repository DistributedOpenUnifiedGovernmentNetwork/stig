# Minimum four servers required.  The first list is from the USNO NTP
# server listing.  The second is from the open.pool.org project.
#
# None of these meet CATII SV-26307r1_rule for the autokey requirement.  
# The public / private keys need to be obtained for use with approved servers 
# and added to the system.  Example syntax as follows:
#
# server ntp2.usno.navy.mil autokey
#
# Add approved servers with keys to the system to this list prior to running 
# the script. NTP will be configured with the servers in this list.
