stig based system security lockdown

Version 0.9
May 2014

The scripts in this project are designed to secure Ubuntu 12.04.  The scripts are based 
on the DISA unclassified STIG documentation for securing Redhat, as well as general DISA guidelines 
for applications and operating systems.  They automate securing a system OS or database based on a 
review of the STIG documentation and guidelines.

The OS lockdown is designed and tested for Ubuntu 12.03 and 12.04 LTS.

The scripts are designed for the ROGUE JCTD project and decisions are based on that project.
The scripts are compatible or configurable with other Ubuntu 12.03 or 12.04.

A Postgresql database script may eventually be written.  PostGIS is the database of choice for the project
and is part of the Geoserver distribution primarily for admin purposes but ROGUE is using this distribution
database for an open distribution, single server distribution architecture.

There are implementation specific considerations that are identified in the lockdown report. Adding the 
report with this distribution has not been decided yet.

The scripts only correct findings not found to be compliant with the DISA STIG or guides. If the OS out of the box
meets the lockdown then no fix was scripted. A manual review was conducted of all CATI and CATII.  CATIII items were not reviewed. 

In some cases findings were considered "site specific issues" and are not addressed in the scripts, nor are findings deemed out of scope. 
An example of this is Postgres not using a FIPS compliant algorithm to secure passwords. The project these scripts are designed for
will not address those issues.

To Do:

A complete "To Do" list will be compiled later but for now this is what I am working on:

Completed: 

- Break all the rule lockdowns into separate functions and add a function call list to the top.  This way the executed functions can be adjusted to testing / trouble shooting.
- Better function checking instead of abrupt breaks.
- Checks to see if a lockdown has been conducted before conducting the lockdown.
- Can reuse the script as a lockdown script.  Before was designed for a fresh install only. It is now suitable for later use.

Still to do (some of them anyway):

- SV-26307r1. Do a check for ntp crypto servers and not a default unclass assumption response.
- SV-27203r1_rule. Check to see if the postgres is used as a application account, user or both.  If not strictly an application account move the user home 
  out of the postgres application directory.
- SV-760r6_rule. Remove postgres direct login. A decision still has to be made about the vagrant account.
